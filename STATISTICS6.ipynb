    "In hypothesis testing, Type I and Type II errors are two types of errors that can occur when making decisions about the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (Ha). These errors are associated with the incorrect rejection or acceptance of a null hypothesis based on sample data.\n",

    "Suppose a pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug for its effectiveness in treating a certain condition. They set up their hypothesis test as follows:\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): The new drug has no effect (i.e., it's not better than a placebo).\\\n",
